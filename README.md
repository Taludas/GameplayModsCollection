### Coffee and Tobacco in Enbesa
This mod enables you to plant Coffee and Tobacco in Enbesa and modifies the Coffee Production chain.
Coffee and Tobacco fertility are distributed on Enbesan Islands at the Game Start. So if you want the fertility on the whole island, you have to start a new game.

**If you don't want to start a new game**, you can use items to provide fertilities on your island. Those items can be bought at Ketemas harbour.
**OR** you use the Research Institute to change the fertilities of the Islands.
**OR** you can use the Anden Set from my botanical garden in Enbesa mod to get the Tobacco fertility and the Enchanted Set to get the coffee fertility.

I modified the Coffee Production chain to use Cotton Fabric for NW and Linen Cloth for Enbesa as a way to show that the coffee is packed up in sacks before export to make it a little bit more difficult to spam Coffee.

There are four versions:
* Normal version with Coffee Roaster requiring linen or cotton cloth respectively.
* Light version where the Coffee Roasters in Enbesa use linen cloth only.
* Super Light version where Coffee Roasters are not altered at all.
* Farms Only. Does what it says on the label.

### Burrito Boom

Craving a flavor-packed fiesta for your taste buds? Look no further than our sizzling, mouthwatering burritos!

Picture this: tender, marinated meat, grilled to perfection and paired with creamy, vibrant guacamole, all nestled together in the blanket of a warm, soft tortilla.

Your citizens have stumbled upon an old family recipe, using regional ingredients, which together taste so good, that people from all over the globe come to your colony to taste this flavor paradise. The new ingredients are:
- Meat (uses 'Cattles need to be butcherd' Mod if present)
- Guacamole made from fresh Avocado and fine-tuned with hot spices (requires LoL or Seeds of Change/Hacienda).
- Tortillas made from corn, extracted using an old technique called Nixtamalization, which requires pot ash.

In return for your increased efforts, more people will come to your town due to the enormous popularity of the new recipe (+5 inhabitants for Obrero and Artista residences from Burritos, standard plus 50% Productivity for Burrito Maker).

Needs either the Land of Lions or Seeds of Change DLC for acquisition of spices.

### Forest Glass

Also known as Waldglas in German, refers to a type of glass that was produced during the late medieval and early modern periods in Europe, particularly in the regions of Germany and Bohemia. It is characterized by its distinct green color and often exhibits a slightly crude or uneven texture.

Forest glass was primarily used for making drinking vessels, bottles, and window panes. Its production was a significant industry in the forested areas where it thrived, hence the name 'forest glass'.

Ingredients:
- Quartz sand
- wood ash to provide potash (K2CO3) as flux.

The green color of forest glass is attributed to impurities present in the raw materials, particularly iron oxide from the sand and plant ashes used. These impurities, combined with the specific firing conditions in the forest glass production, resulted in the distinctive green hue.

To compensate the increased resource input, there are several buffs in place:
- a standard 10% production boost on the glasshouse.
- a near field buff coming from the glasshouses and boosting potash and woodcutter buildings in its vicinity (+50% Productivity).
- a return buff from potash and woodcutter buildings to increase productivity of the glasshouse (+10% Productivity per building).

This ensures a good synergy effect, if the buildings are built in close range, as it is historically correct.

This mod will automatically modify other mods using the vanilla glassworks/adding new production chains using the glass chain.

### High Life Souvenirs / Low Life Souvenirs

After the introduction of the first form of modern era Plastics in the DLC 'High Life', the Production Chain for Souvenirs felt a little lackluster. Obviously the use of Campher Wax and Cotton resembled the ingredients of celluloid plastic. But why use this anymore after the introduction of the celluloid ware with High Life?

To spice things up a little, I reimagened the Souvenirs to be made of Celluloid for the stand, Gold for the snowflakes and model inside and Glass for the bulb.

You can now also sell the Souvenirs to your Tourists not only in the Hotels directly but also in little Souvenir Stands around the place. This reduces overall sells in the Hotels (-50% Need reduction), gives extra money and attracts a lot of new tourists (+50 Tourists from Souvenirs, +5% visit chance on the Tourist Peer)!

If you use iMYA you can choose between two variants of the mod. One with expansive souvenirs made form gold in a artisan workshop (High Life Souvenirs) and the other with cheap ones made in an assembly line out of brass (Low Life Souvenirs). You can also activate both sub-mods to get the full experience.

### Slippery Soap

Historically soap was the first modern product used for cleaning of body and cloths. It was made by boiling animal fat in an alkaline solution over several hours. In Anno this process is poorly represented.

Therefore I included Potash into the production chain as a early version of the alkaline additive. Potash can be obtained by burning wood and extracting the remains with water.

Hope this new soap recipe makes it a little bit more realistic for you!

### The True Jam Experience

Ever wondered why Jam grows directly on trees in Anno 1800?

Because they chose the simple way. But I don't like it the simple way. So I took the idea and assets from Lrds42 and made a separat mod that only adds a new Jam Production Chain based on Cherries, Sugar and Glas.

You'll need 1t of Cherries/min, 0.5t of Sugar and Glass/min to produce 1t Jam/min.

The Jam manufactory is now a Multifactory so we can expand it in the future with different Jam flavours.

To get a nice boost on the new production facility there is a special item: 'Marlene - Mother of Marmelades'. She is buyable at Eli.

Compatibility between Lordys, Kurilas and my mod is provided by [Kurila](https://github.com/Qurila)! Big Thank you for that!

### Free Farmfield Placement

(Moved over from Wholesome Hacienda Haul)

This mod is an update of the mod "[Free Farmfield Placement](https://www.nexusmods.com/anno1800/mods/26)" by Finnem. The fields of all farms and animal farms incl. Hacienda farms, as well as all modded farms (e.g. farms from 'The Wholesome Hacienda Overhaul' or Jakob's mods) can now be placed freely in their radius. The original mod is no longer required. The radius of plant, animal and Hacienda Farms can be adjusted with the iModYourAnno Modmanager to fit your own playstyle.

### Glasshouses for Orchid Farms

This little mod changes the not very accurate farm fields of the Orchid Farm to one that actually could make sense. Orchids are usually parasitic plants, growing on trees. So them growing in plain farming soil is not really close to reality. Also the usage of a Tractor to harvest the Orchids is as sensitive as the use of a chainsaw on those precious plants.

Therefore, this mod changes the one tile fields to actual Greenhouses, reducing the number of field module needed, but also getting rid of the tractor boost.

***Warning***: Before installing, make sure your Orchid Farms (or at least their fields) have been deleted. Otherwise you might get funny clipping issues and non removable fences which previously sourrounded your fields!

If you use the Hacienda Overhaul Mod, note that the Orchid Fields for the Hacienda Farm will not change, due to the mechanic behind the recipe building.

### Jalea & Mezcal Integration

This mod integrates the Jalea and Mezcal products into the food and drink venues of the New World Tourism mod. This is inspired by the vanilla usage of the bar/restaurant graphics for the production buildings.

DLC/Mod Dependency:Â 
- "Tourism" DLC.
- "New World Tourism" Mod

This mod is savegame compatible. You can start it mid-game.Â 
**HOWEVER**: If you currently have Mezcal or Jalea productions, those will no longer work correctly (products are removed from the warehouses!). Also Traderoutes with these products will no longer work.

Features:
- replace Jalea, Coffee and Mezcal needs for all Artista buildings with the need for Restaurant, CafÃ© and Bar (needs are distributed to Artista residences WITHOUT the need for bus connection - distribution is done over street range!). Mezcal lifestyle needs have been replaced with Lemonade for Engineers and Technicians and Atole for Tourists. Buffs that reduce Mezcal consumption have been edited to reduce Cognac need.
- remove Jalea and Mezcal from the "normal" warehouse storagelists and remove/disable their usual production buildings
- add Jalea, PharisÃ¤er and Mezcal as recipes to the Restaurant, CafÃ© and Bar from New World Tourism.
